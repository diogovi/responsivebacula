<header>Automatically add appropriate SuExec directive?</header>
 If selected, SuExec will be enabled for the virtual server.  SuExec is a feature of Apache that allows CGI scripts to be executed with only the privileges of the owner of the directory where the script is located.  It also introduces other protections to help prevent insecure script usage, such as refusing to run scripts that have lax permissions (for example, those that are group or world writeable).  SuExec is highly recommended except for in environments where all domain owners are trusted users. SuExec does present some limitations, such as the inability to run scripts "in-process" using modules like mod_perl or mod_python.  With modern hardware, performance is rarely a major concern in a shared hosting environment, and shouldn't take precedence over security.
