<header>Backup compression format</header>

By default, Virtualmin uses gzip compression on its backup files. However, this
option can be used to select the space efficient (but CPU-intensive) bzip2
format instead. You can also use un-compressed tar format backups, which may be useful
if you want a speedy backup, or if you are writing to tape. <p>

This option is only used when backing up virtual servers to a directory, with
one file per domain. When backing up to a single file, the filename determines
the compression format (like <tt>domains.tar.gz</tt> or <tt>domains.tar</tt>).
