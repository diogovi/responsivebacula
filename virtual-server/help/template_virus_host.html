<header>Server host for clamd-stream-client</header>

This field should be used to enter the hostname of the remote system on
which <tt>clamd</tt> runs, to which virus-laden email messages will be sent
by <tt>clamd-stream-client</tt> for scanning. It has no effect if you select
<tt>clamscam</tt> or <tt>clamdscan</tt> for scanning, as they always only
check for viruses locally. <p>
