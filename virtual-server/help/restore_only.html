<header>Only create servers with selected features?</header>

When this option is set to <b>No</b> (the default), when a domain is restored
that does not yet exist on the system, Virtualmin will create it with all the
features that were in the original virtual server. If you want to disable some
features when restoring, you can instead select <b>Yes</b> and de-select them in
the <b>Features and Settings</b> section. <p>
